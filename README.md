Personal Health Management System:
 - Practice general Software Engineering life cycles of Specification, Design, Implementation and Testing via programming an Android application. This class will be utilizing a Plan-driven Software Engineering approach and not an agile methodology.
 - Develop an android application to help users maintain various personal health-related data. This application will be used for keeping track of one’s vital signs, daily medicine intake, or following a diet regiment. The system should minimally include:

  1. Registration: Enter personal information such as name, gender, age, weight, height, doctor’s name, doctor visit dates, annual checkups, etc.
  2. Vital signs: Registering vital signs (e.g. blood pressure, glucose level, Cholesterol, …)
  3. Medication: Medication the patient is taking and time to take it, include a notification/alarm system for taking medication
  4. Diet: Allow individual to keep track of their food intake, calorie count and their weight
  5. Electronic storage: Allow individual to keep their favorite recipes, diet descriptions, health articles in this system
  6. System should be secure: To prevent unauthorized access. This is particularly important in order to avoid falsifying/altering  information (such as Medicine type or intake time)
  7. Search: Search capability to find stored or general data
  8. Monitoring system: Application should inform the individual or other designees (e.g. children of an elderly or doctor / pharmacist) in case medicine is not consumed, or it has life-threatening medical conflict with other medicine. 
  9. Communication: E-mail, cell phone calls and text message should be all provided for relevant communication information
  10. Data Maintenance: The data should easily be maintainable (i.e. to add a new doctor or a new medicine to the system should not need programming)
